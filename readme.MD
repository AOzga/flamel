# Why?
Tbh as every weekend/evening project it's just a <code>whim</code>
I am just going to go through python std and implement some weird shit like

```python 
exec('a=eval(f"type(\'4lulz\').{eval(\'....__dir__()\')[4]}.__doc__[-54:-51]")\nexec(f\'import {a}\')\neval(f\'print({a}.{\"\".join([chr(x) for x in [7*2**1341>>1337,776>>3,232>>1,13<<3]])})\')')
```
basically im messing around

The exec on top just prints your path
I like that ... is its own object
